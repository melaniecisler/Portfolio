Project Title: Responsive Portfolio

Description: In this project I created a responsive website that renders well on a variety of devices or screen sizes. 

Some challenges I faced was making the layout and trying to not overlap some of my images in the portfolio page. I also had
issues getting the spacing in the navbar right. I tried to use bootstrap as much as possible to make my program more efficient. 

This is important because efficiency in web design is sought out and obviously preferred so Bootstrap makes creating
these layouts much easier. 

My motivation to build this project was to help put my porfolio out there and have an accessible 
website that is informational and easy to navigate.
